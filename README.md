# TaskEase-Simplifying-Your-Day
TaskEase is a feature-rich Todo Task List application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, NodeJS). It aims to simplify task management and enhance productivity by providing an intuitive and interactive user interface.
## Requirements
 - MongoDB Compass (I have used the one for Ubuntu)
 - NodeJS
## Steps to run
1. Create a new project named "todo" with the command `` npx create-react-app todo  ``
2. In the src folder of the app, overwrite the code of the existing files (and create new ones such as server.js) with the ones I have uploaded.
3. Open the MongoDB Compass and connect to ``localhost:27017``
4. Create a database named "todoApp" with a collection named "todo"
5. Navigate to the src folder of the app in terminal and type ``node server.js ``. It should display the lines:
   Connected to MongoDB server
   Server is running on port 5000
7. In the app folder (i.e. outside src) run ``npm start``
8. Your app is now Up and Running!
